# Sales-Forecasting-Using-python

Developed a comprehensive sales forecasting model aimed at predicting future product sales using historical retail data. This project involved end-to-end data analysis, preprocessing, and implementation of predictive modeling techniques.

Key Highlights:

-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted in-depth analysis to understand trends, missing values, and data distribution across key features like item type, outlet size, and outlet location.
-Data Cleaning & Imputation: Applied logical imputation techniques for missing values using group-based means (e.g., item weight by identifier) and mode-based inference for categorical features.
-Feature Engineering: Derived insights from categorical columns, handled label inconsistencies, and prepared the dataset for model training.
-Tools & Libraries: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.
-Outcome: Built a predictive model capable of estimating item-level sales, supporting better inventory and pricing decisions for retail outlets.

This project demonstrates proficiency in data wrangling, visualization, and applying machine learning
